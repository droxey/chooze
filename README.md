# ChoozeBooze
<p> Using the CocktailDB API ChoozeBooze is a webapp created with with Django intending to answer the "what am I going to drink" question by giving the user a randomly generated drink, the ingredients and the recipe. capability for the user to filter their drink by ingredient. User will be able to save drinks that they like, and manage their list of drinks. This app solves a problem I have seen frequently during my time working as a bartender, not knowing what to drink, or how to order a drink out of their comfort zone. Above all, the app is just a fun game to see all the crazy cocktails people have created over time. </p>
